# 👗 Outfit Suggestor (Python CLI)

A tiny, aesthetic **Outfit Suggestor** you can run in your terminal.  
It picks a top, bottom, shoes, optional outerwear, and an accessory based on:

- Occasion (casual, work, party, home)
- Weather (cold, mild, warm)
- Optional color vibe (like `pink`, `black`, `beige`)

Perfect mini project to show off some Python logic, randomness, and cute branding.
