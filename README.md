Outfit Studio

Outfit Studio is a small mood-based outfit generator.
You choose the occasion, the weather, and an optional color focus, and the app creates a full outfit for the day.

It builds a look using pieces from a virtual closet, matching items based on your vibe and conditions.
The results include a top, bottom, outerwear (when needed), shoes, and an accessory, all coordinated by style, weather, and color.

The interface is designed to feel soft, artistic, and intentional — blurred glass panel, custom color palette, and a painterly background that makes the app feel like a tiny creative studio.
